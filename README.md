### Epyk and CodePen!

Epyk report can be shared on Codepen.

Presentation
================================
As the main target of Epyk is to propose a fully collaborative way to develop and also share wroks one important milestone was
to get fully integrated with the usual web ecosystem.

As most of the implementation of Epyk have been done based on one tutorials (which are in the Framework documentation), it makes
sense to reuse those containers to test and share work

Compatibility
================================

Epyk will use from Python the REST API of Codepen to split the reports and create automatically the right string to be pushed to
an anonymous page.

Do not hesitate to dhare your work on the framework with us and to give us your feedbacks.

Also this is quite useful for sharing issues on Stackoverflow.
